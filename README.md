This is a simple Windows app that is made with C# 

This is the first app I've made using Visual Studio C# 2016. this code was originally created by Microsoft in their text book: Microsoft Visual C# 2013 Step by Step.
I have added additional code to handle division from zero to avoid the program to break.
